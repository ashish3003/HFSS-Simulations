# HFSS-Simulations
HFSS simulations for Rectangular, Circular waveguides and H-bends

S-band designs for Waveguides with Dominant mode propagation are presented.

Waveguide bends are also simulated with different bend radius such as:

1. radius = 1.5*b
2. radius = b/2
3. radius = 3*b

In 1st and 3rd case, one can observe that Poynting Vector shows little or no reflections while in 2nd case, reflections can be observed. This is in accordance with theoretical assertions.
